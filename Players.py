# The Players.py class will be a manager of the players. Players contains a data structure, maybe an                  #
# arraylist idk yet which data structure would be best in python. I'm new to python :P!                               #
#                                                                                                                     #
# Anyway there will be get set and add remove and reset functions for the player to be used in mass. muhahahahahaha   #
